# Quick Test Guide - Verify Everything Works

## âœ… Status: Your Neon Database is Connected!

I've verified that:
- âœ… Neon database is reachable
- âœ… Tables exist (User and Task)
- âœ… Prisma client connects successfully
- âœ… Application builds without errors
- âœ… Dev server is ready

## Test Your Application Now

### 1. Access the App
Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Register Your First User

1. Click "Register" or go to http://localhost:3000/register
2. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Email:    test@example.com
   Password: password123
   Role:     Student
   ```
3. Click "Register"
4. âœ… You should see "Account created. Redirecting to login..."

### 3. Login

1. You'll be redirected to the login page
2. Enter your credentials:
   ```
   Email:    test@example.com
   Password: password123
   Role:     Student
   ```
3. Click "Login"
4. âœ… You should be redirected to the dashboard

### 4. Create a Task

1. In the sidebar, click "Task Management"
2. Click the blue "+ Add Task" button
3. Fill in:
   ```
   Task Title:   Complete Math Homework
   Description:  Finish chapters 5-7
   Due Date:     (pick tomorrow)
   Assigned to:  (leave blank or add a name)
   ```
4. Click "Create Task"
5. âœ… Your task appears in the list!

### 5. Test Task Management

Try these actions:
- âœ… **Change Status**: Click the status buttons (Not Started â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed)
- âœ… **Edit Task**: Click the pencil icon to edit
- âœ… **Delete Task**: Click the trash icon to delete
- âœ… **View Dashboard**: Go to "Dashboard" to see statistics

### 6. Verify Data in Neon

1. Go to your Neon dashboard: https://console.neon.tech
2. Click your "TaskTrekDB" project
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Run these queries:

```sql
-- See your registered user
SELECT id, email, role, "createdAt" FROM "User";

-- See your tasks
SELECT id, title, status, "dueDate" FROM "Task";

-- See everything together
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  t.title as task_title,
  t.status,
  t."dueDate"
FROM "User" u
LEFT JOIN "Task" t ON u.id = t."userId";
```

âœ… You should see your data!

## Test Logout

1. Click the red "Logout" button in the top right
2. âœ… You should be redirected to the login page
3. Login again - your tasks are still there!

## Verify Persistence

1. Close your browser completely
2. Open it again and go to http://localhost:3000
3. Login with your credentials
4. âœ… All your tasks are still there! (They're in Neon, not localStorage)

## Test with Multiple Users

1. Logout
2. Register a new user (different email)
3. Login with the new user
4. Create some tasks
5. âœ… Each user only sees their own tasks!

## Quick Database Check Command

Run this anytime to check your database:

```bash
node test-db-connection.js
```

This will show:
- How many users are in your database
- How many tasks exist
- Recent users (without passwords)

## Common Test Scenarios

### âœ… Test Password Security
1. Register with password "test123"
2. Go to Neon SQL Editor
3. Run: `SELECT password FROM "User" LIMIT 1;`
4. âœ… You'll see a hashed password (not "test123")

### âœ… Test Role-Based Features
1. Register as "Student"
2. Register as "Admin" (different email)
3. Both can create and manage tasks

### âœ… Test Task Due Dates
1. Create task due tomorrow
2. Go to Dashboard
3. âœ… See it in "Upcoming Deadlines"

### âœ… Test Progress Tracking
1. Create 3 tasks
2. Mark 1 as "In Progress"
3. Mark 1 as "Completed"
4. Go to "Progress Tracking"
5. âœ… See the breakdown and progress bar

## Troubleshooting

### Can't register?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure email is unique
- Check that dev server is running

### Login fails?
- Email and password are case-sensitive
- Make sure you're selecting the correct role
- Try registering again with a new email

### Tasks not appearing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in (check top right for your email)
- Refresh the page

### Database errors?
- Run: `node test-db-connection.js`
- Check your `.env.local` file exists
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

## Next: Deploy to Vercel

Once everything works locally:

1. Go to Vercel â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string
3. Push to GitHub
4. âœ… Your app will be live!
